POWER BI DASHBOARD
USED A DATASET FROM KAGGLE Data Science, AI & ML Job Salaries in 2025
Created an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze salary trends in Data Science, AI, and ML roles.
The project involved data cleaning, transformation, and visualization to highlight insights based on job roles, experience levels, and locations.
This enhanced my skills in end-to-end dashboard development and visual storytelling using Power BI.
